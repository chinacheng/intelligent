This is a simple web application used ruby193, rails3.2.2, mysql and so on. 
As the "Hello World" is eternal, c c++ java ruby javascript perl node go or structs hibernate spring rails and so on will do.
Simple will rule the world, but simple is not fool, it wise and powerful.
Nothing but only seriously. Never give up and never to bend to any 'muddle along'.
